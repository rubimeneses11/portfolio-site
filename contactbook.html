        <p>
          ContactBook is a .NET web application built to function as a contact
          book. I built this project using the MVC design pattern. This web
          application works along a postgres database to create, edit, and
          delete contacts and categories. It includes email functionality to
          email a specific person in your contacts or to email multiple people
          on your contact list that share a common category. This web
          application implements user authentication and authorization so anyone
          wanting to use this application must create an account or be signed
          into their existing account.

          <h3>Road bumps & Thought Process</h3>
          <p>
            Like most projects, I ran into many problems along the way, one
            particularly difficult area was code structure and organization.
            This being such a large project for me, I knew staying structured
            and organized would be very important.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern allowed me to
            lay out my code in an organized manner and find errors rather
            quickly. I knew I wanted to implement user authentication &
            authorization, as well as perform CRUD operations. Entity & Identity
            were tools I used that allowed me to make those ideas a reality as
            well as continue to keep my project organized and loosely coupled.

          <h3>Lessons & Takeaways</h3>
          <p>
            I could spend all day describing the lessons that I learned while
            working on this project, but the most important ones involved my
            newfound understanding of the 4 pillars of object-oriented
            programming, LINQ, and the importance of well structured and
            organized code. This has been my biggest project using C# and it has
            taught me that writing sloppy code can easily come back to bite you.
            I now spend more time refactoring and improving every line of code I
            write, for the best readability and far fewer headaches.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            On the non-technical side of things, I was happy to bring my
            creativity out with the application's design. Although I did take
            chunks from a couple of bootstrap templates to make this UI, I did
            enjoy branding it completely in my own way. I used Canva for the
            logo and the branding. Anytime I am able to design any small or
            large components for a site, it makes me very enthusiastic and keeps
            me motivated.
